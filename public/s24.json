In problem sets, students read current literature, develop their skills in Python and R, and interpret quantitative results in a biological manner. In the second half of term, students work in groups to complete a project in which they apply the computational approaches covered.","n":"Analysis of Biological Networks","i":"B. Bryson, P.
