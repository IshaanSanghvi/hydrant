    Hydrant does not store any of your data outside of your browser. Data is
    only transmitted upstream when you export to Google Calendar. When you
    export to Google Calendar, Hydrant sends calendar information to Google to
    place into your calendar.
  </p>
  <p>
    No data is transmitted otherwise. That means that our servers do not store
    your class or calendar information. If you never export to Google Calendar
    we never send your data anywhere else.
